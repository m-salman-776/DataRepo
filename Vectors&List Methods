Following are the some common operation on some of most freqeutly use STL

1.Vector
    
    reverse()
    push_back(ele)
    pop_back() only delete last element does not return any reference 
    back() returns the reference to the last element of the vector
    at(i) return the reference of element at  'i' th indext 
    erase(i) remove element ith position from vector
    erase(startpos , endpos)
    
    Modifiers:

    assign() – It assigns new value to the vector elements by replacing old ones
    push_back() – It push the elements into a vector from the back
    pop_back() – It is used to pop or remove elements from a vector from the back.
    insert() – It inserts new elements before the element at the specified position
    erase() – It is used to remove elements from a container from the specified position or range.
    swap() – It is used to swap the contents of one vector with another vector of same type and size.
    clear() – It is used to remove all the elements of the vector container
    emplace() – It extends the container by inserting new element at position
    emplace_back() – It is used to insert a new element into the vector container, the new element is added to the end of the vector
 
 
 
 2.List : Frequent function used in list
        
        front() Return the value of first element of the list 
        back() Return the value of last element of the list
        push_front(val) pushes values at front
        push_back(val) pushes val at back
        pop_front() remove first element 
        pop_back()  remove last element
        
        insert() – Inserts new elements in the list before the element at a specified position.
        erase() – Removes a single element or a range of elements from the list
